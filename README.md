<h5> Parallel Matrix Multiplication </h5>


This project uses Java's MPI (Message Passing Interface) to divide Matrix Multiplication to 8-ways or 64-ways parallel tasks, assigns them to processes in the available computing cluster and adds the intermediate matrices to obtain the final result. We tested Matrix Multiplication on 1024X1024 input matrices. It took roughtly 15s to compute the product using 64-ways parallel approach.
